First commit of this project, i've been working on it a few days now. Wanting to build a stable version before publishing. The base of this game was made with gpt, it had alot of errors to resolve and needed features added despite my speicific prompt but was still a great starting point. Its ai currently guesses based on frequency analysis, using the MIT 10,000 world list. I plan on updating into a more a advnaced model over time
